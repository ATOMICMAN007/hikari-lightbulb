Lightbulb
=========

Lightbulb is a command handler library designed for use with `Hikari <https://gitlab.com/nekokatt/hikari>`_

It aims to provide an easy to use interface for building commands with your bot.

This library is currently unfinished but you can help speed up the development by contributing and submitting merge requests to the repository. It is working in its current state but I'd love to see more functionality added further down the line!
